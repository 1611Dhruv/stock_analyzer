# Backend Engineer Trial Task

## Objective

Create a Django-based backend system that fetches financial data from a specific public API, stores it in a relational database, implements a basic backtesting module using this historical data, and generates reports with performance results. The focus is on Django development, API integration, and deployment.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to fetch daily stock prices for specified stock symbols from the Alpha Vantage API, store the data in a PostgreSQL database, and allow users to perform backtesting on the data. Additionally, it includes a simple machine learning model integration for predicting future stock prices based on historical data.

## Technologies Used

- Django
- Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL
- Alpha Vantage API
- Docker
- Matplotlib or Plotly (for visualizations)
- GitHub Actions (for CI/CD)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PostgreSQL
- Docker
- Git

### Local Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up the Database**:

   - Create a PostgreSQL database and user.
   - Update the `settings.py` file with your database credentials.

5. **Run Migrations**:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Start the Development Server**:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project to store sensitive information, such as API keys.

```
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
DATABASE_URL=postgres://<username>:<password>@localhost:5432/<database_name>
```

## API Endpoints

### Financial Data

- **POST** `/financial_data/add`  
  _Body_: `{ "symbol": "<stock_symbol>" }`  
  _Description_: Adds a new stock symbol.

- **POST** `/financial_data/refresh`  
  _Description_: Refreshes the existing symbols by fetching updated data from the API.

- **GET** `/financial_data/data`  
  _Description_: Lists all existing stock symbols.

- **GET** `/financial_data/data?symbol=<symbol>`  
  _Description_: Retrieves data about a specific stock symbol.

### Backtesting Module

- **GET** `/back_test?format=<pdf|json>&symbol=<symbol>&winsell=<sell_condition>&winbuy=<buy_condition>`  
  _Description_: Performs backtesting on the given symbol based on specified parameters.

### Machine Learning Predictions

- **GET** `/ai_prediction?symbol=<symbol>`  
  _Description_: Gets predictions for the next 30 days for the specified symbol and adds them to the database.

### Reporting

- **GET** `/reporting/`  
  _Description_: Provides a backend interface to generate reports, including adding new symbols, generating AI predictions, and backtesting reports.

## Backtesting Module

The backtesting module allows users to input parameters for a simple trading strategy, including:

- **Initial Investment Amount**
- **Buy Condition**: When the stock price dips below a specified moving average (e.g., 50-day average).
- **Sell Condition**: When the stock price exceeds a different moving average (e.g., 200-day average).

### Output

The backtesting module calculates the return on investment based on the specified parameters and generates a performance summary including total return, maximum drawdown, and the number of trades executed.

## Machine Learning Integration

The project uses a pre-trained machine learning model to predict future stock prices based on historical data. The model is loaded from a `.pkl` file and integrated into a Django API endpoint.

## Report Generation

Reports are generated after backtesting or using machine learning predictions. The reports include:

- Key financial metrics from the backtest.
- Visual comparisons between predicted and actual stock prices (using Matplotlib or Plotly).
- Available in PDF and JSON formats.

## Deployment

The Django application is deployed on AWS or a similar cloud provider. The deployment includes:

- Dockerized setup for the application.
- AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) for database storage.
- CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated deployment.
- Secure handling of environment variables.

### Deployment Steps

1. **Build the Docker Image**:

   ```bash
   docker build -t <image_name> .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**:

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8000:8000 <image_name>
   ```

3. **Set Up AWS RDS**: Create a PostgreSQL instance on AWS RDS and configure your Django settings to connect.

4. **Deploy with CI/CD**: Configure GitHub Actions or your preferred CI/CD tool for automated deployment.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **API Integration**: Efficient fetching of financial data with proper error handling.
2. **Backtesting Logic**: Accurate calculation of returns and performance metrics.
3. **ML Integration**: Seamless integration of a pre-trained machine learning model.
4. **Reporting**: Insightful reports with visualizations in multiple formats.
5. **Deployment**: Production-ready, secure, and scalable application.
6. **Documentation**: Clear and detailed `README.md` for setup and deployment.
